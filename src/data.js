        "Microneedling is an amazing procedure for skin resurfacing acne scaring, hyperpigmentation, and aging signs. The way microneedling aids in skin resurfacing is by activating the skin's natural healing processes. This is done by puncturing the skin with thousands of tiny needles, creating temporary “trauma” to the skin. These thousands of punctures signal your skin cells to turn over at a significantly higher rate than normal, causing new skin to come to the surface which ultimately aids in evening out scars, and lifting dull skin. The punctures also induce natural collagen production of the skin, which is why it also aids in softening any signs of aging. Dependent upon your goals, we recommend a package of 3 to see significant results. All procedures end with soothing mask and  post treatment aftercare is provided after each session.",
